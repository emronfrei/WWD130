      <h3>[Why move to mid Michigan?]</h3>
      <p> 
        There are so many reasons to move to mid michigan. one of the largest is the cost of living; here in mid michigan the cost of living is far below the national avrage, so you can keep more of your money for other activities.
        the people are so kind and will help you at any chance they get. Being outdoors is part of the michigander experince there are hundreads of miles of trails and so many beaches that your are sure to love. Michigan has 3 seasons: Winter, Road Construction, and Dead of Winter. Haha We are just jokeing, Michigan has all four seasons winter is usualy December to March. It snows quite a bit, so be prepared. other than that Summer and Fall are the best time of the year.
