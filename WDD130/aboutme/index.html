    <p>Currently, I am working at a cider mill in my hometown in Michigan. I love BYU-I because I can grow as a diciple of Jesus Christ, and I can look for a wife too! haha. </p>
    <p>I am taking this class because it is required for my degree, but dont get me wrong I want to learn about web design so i can create my own webpages for my future small company.  </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints all my life. my favroite scripture is in 2 Nephi 9:51-52 </p>
